## Technical Background

### Backend
- Python (FastAPI, Django)
- REST API design
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Schema design and indexing
- Error handling and logging

### Frontend
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React, Next.js
- HTML, CSS
- State management fundamentals
- Component-driven UI

### AI Integration
- OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Prompt design for structured extraction
- JSON validation and fallback strategies
- AI-assisted development workflows

### Deployment
- Render, Railway, Netlify, Vercel
- Git-based workflows
- Environment configuration management

---

## Why This Stack

### Backend: FastAPI + SQLite

FastAPI provides:
- Clear API structure
- Automatic documentation
- Strong typing with Pydantic

SQLite is sufficient for this scope:
- Zero configuration
- File-based persistence
- Reliable for small datasets

---

### Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript

This was an intentional decision.

The application scope includes:
- One primary workflow
- Limited state complexity
- Minimal component reuse

Using React would introduce:
- Build configuration
- Deployment pipeline complexity
- Additional abstraction not required for this problem size

Vanilla JS:
- Ships faster
- Reduces failure surface
- Demonstrates core fundamentals

For larger-scale applications with complex shared state, I use React or Next.js.

---

## Engineering Principles

- Prefer reliability over novelty
- Document trade-offs explicitly
- Design for failure modes
- Keep systems understandable
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction

---

## Availability

Open to full-time backend or full-stack roles, especially teams building AI-enabled products.
